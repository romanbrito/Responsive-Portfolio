    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/MainPic.jpg" alt="RomanBrito" class="auth-image">
        <p>My interest in computers began at at age 8 when I got my first PC
          and continued in High School when I won a couple
          of coding competitions.  For some reason, that up to date I still donâ€™t
          understand, I decided to go into Economics and Finance obtaining a BA in Economics
          and a Masters in Finance from <span><a href="http://egade.desarrolloapps.com.mx/en/" target="_blank">ITESM/EGADE</a></span> and decided to go into investment banking
          and eventually became a small business owner.  Currently I own three locations of a
          restaurant called Texadelphia and employ over 30 people.  Within the restaurant
          industry I see potential to develop applications in a wide range of areas, from
          advertising and loyalty programs to cost analytics and logistics.
